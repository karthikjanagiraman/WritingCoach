## Phase 1: Direct Instruction

### Coach Message 1 (Initial Teaching)

```
🦉 Hi Emma! Today we're going to learn something super cool — 
how to write a HOOK! 🎣

A hook is the very first sentence of your story. It's called a 
hook because it "hooks" readers like a fish! It makes them SO 
curious that they HAVE to keep reading.

Here's an example of a great hook:

   "The door wasn't there yesterday."

Whoa! That makes me wonder: What door? Where did it come from? 
I NEED to know what happens next!

Here's another one:

   "Maya heard the voice again, but no one was there."

Spooky, right? I want to keep reading!

Quick question for you, Emma: What makes these hooks 
interesting? Why would someone want to keep reading?
```

### Student Response 1

```
because they make you want to know what happens next and 
theyre kind of mysterious
```

### Coach Message 2 (Comprehension Confirmed)

```
🦉 Yes!! That's exactly right! ⭐

Hooks create MYSTERY and make readers CURIOUS. They make you 
ask questions like "What happens next?" or "How did that happen?"

You totally get it! Ready to practice writing some hooks together?
```

### Student Response 2

```
yes!
```

## Phase 2: Guided Practice

### Coach Message 3 (Exercise Introduction)

```
🦉 Awesome! Let's practice! 

Here's a boring story beginning:

   "It was a sunny day."

That's okay, but it doesn't make me curious. Can you rewrite 
it to make it a HOOK that makes readers want to keep reading?

Remember: make it mysterious or exciting! Make readers ask questions!
```

### Student Response 3

```
The sun was shining really bright.
```

### Coach Message 4 (Light Scaffold)

```
🦉 You're describing the day, which is a good start! 

But I'm not curious yet — I don't have any questions. What if 
something UNUSUAL happened on this sunny day? 

What could happen that would make readers say "Wait, WHAT?!"
```

### Student Response 4

```
The sun was shining but then it started raining frogs!
```

### Coach Message 5 (Positive + Push Deeper)

```
🦉 WHOA! Raining FROGS?! 🐸 Now THAT makes me curious! 

I immediately want to know: Why is it raining frogs? What does 
the character do? That's a great hook!

Can you try one more? This time, make the hook about a person 
instead of the weather. Start with someone doing or seeing 
something surprising!
```

### Student Response 5

```
Lily looked under her bed and saw two glowing eyes looking back at her.
```

### Coach Message 6 (Ready for Assessment)

```
🦉 OH MY GOODNESS! 👀✨

"Two glowing eyes looking back at her" — Emma, that gave me 
CHILLS! I absolutely need to know what's under that bed!

You totally get hooks! You made me curious AND a little scared. 
That's exactly what great hooks do!

You're ready to write your own story beginning with a hook. 
I can't wait to see what you create! 🌟
```

---

## Phase 3: Assessment

### Coach Message 7 (Task Presentation)

```
🦉 Okay Emma, it's YOUR turn! 📝

Write your own story beginning with a great hook.

Your story beginning should have:
✓ A hook that makes readers curious (first sentence!)
✓ A main character (tell us who the story is about)
✓ A setting (tell us where they are)

Try to write 50-75 words. Take your time — I'll read it when 
you're done!

You've got this! 🌟
```

### Student Response 6 (Request for Help)

```
can you give me an idea of what to write about?
```

### Coach Message 8 (Redirect to Independence)

```
🦉 This is your chance to show what you've learned! 

Just start writing — what's the first exciting thing that pops 
into your head? A mystery? A monster? A magical discovery?

Give it your best try, and I'll give you feedback when you're 
done. You've got this!
```

### Student Response 7 (Submission)

```
"Don't open that box!" screamed Grandma. But it was too late. 
Zoe had already lifted the lid, and a strange purple light 
filled the room.

Zoe was 9 years old and loved exploring her grandma's old attic. 
There were always weird things up there. But she had never seen 
this box before. It was covered in dust and had strange symbols 
on it.

She didn't know what she had just done.
```

---

## Phase 4: Feedback

### Coach Message 9 (Assessment Feedback)

```
🦉 WOW, EMMA! This is AMAZING! 🎉

✨ What you did really well:

Your hook is FANTASTIC! "'Don't open that box!' screamed Grandma" 
— I immediately wanted to know: What's in the box? Why is Grandma 
scared? And then "strange purple light filled the room" — SO 
mysterious! I couldn't stop reading!

You also told us about Zoe and her grandma's attic. I can picture 
the dusty old attic with weird things everywhere!

📈 One thing to work on:

I know Zoe is 9 and loves exploring, but what does she LOOK like? 
Does she have curly hair? Glasses? Adding one small detail about 
how Zoe looks would help me picture her even better.

Your ending line "She didn't know what she had just done" gave me 
goosebumps! You're a natural storyteller, Emma! Keep writing! 🌟
